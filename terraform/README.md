# What is Amazon S3?

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web.

It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers and allows you store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. 

It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. 

The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
