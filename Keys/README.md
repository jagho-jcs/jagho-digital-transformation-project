## What is A Key Pair?

A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance. Amazon EC2 stores the public key, and you store the private key. You use the private key, instead of a password, to securely access your instances. Anyone who possesses your private keys can connect to your instances, so it's important that you store your private keys in a secure place.
