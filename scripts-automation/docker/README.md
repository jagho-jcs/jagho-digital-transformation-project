# What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. **Docker** enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With **Docker**, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

This `dockerfile` is built from the `jenkins` official image.  It installs docker and gives access to a user called `jenkinsusr` to build docker images.
