# What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is written in Java.  Jenkins is used in automating those parts of software development which do not require human intervention.  It is used for continous integration and providing technical aspects for the facilitation of continous delivery.  Jenkins is usually installed on the server where the central build takes place.  Continous integration ensures frequent builds by developers.  The usually followed practice ensures that as soon as code commit is done, a build is triggered.

## Why Use Jenkins?

Developers first check their code after that Jenkins picks up the changes in the code and trigger a build and also run any test if required.  Build output from Jenkins is shown its dashboard and a notification can be sent to the developer after the build process is over.  Continous Integration can be defined as a development practice in which developers integrate code into a shared repository on a regular basis. This is done to remove vaious issues in the build lifecycle such as later occurences.
